# Embedding JavaScript in a Web Page

JavaScript was originally written to be the language that web developers could
use to program web pages in a browser. It has since evolved and moved into other
environments (like node.js, for example), but its primary purpose is still as
the scripting language for the web. All modern web browsers support JavaScript.

You may be wondering _how_ to use JavaScript on a web page. Good question! That
is exactly what we are going to focus on in these exercises: the various ways to
add JavaScript to a page.

## Exercises

**Note**: to complete these exercises, you will need to create an HTML file
(which we will refer to here by the name `page.html`). Once you have created the
file, copy the following default content into it and open the file in your
browser.

`page.html`:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Embedding JavaScript</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>JavaScript is fun</h1>

  <p>Did you know that JavaScript is the <em>lingua franca</em> of the web?</p>
</body>
</html>
```
