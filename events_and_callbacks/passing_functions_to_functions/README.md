# Passing Functions to Functions

In JavaScript, you will frequently encounter functions which take other
functions as arguments. This is a powerful technique known as "callback
functions." Callbacks are used all over the place in JavaScript.

Understanding how to work with them and write functions that can take callback
functions is critical.

## Exercise Instructions

1. Open the first javascript file in this directory.
2. Scroll to the bottom to get to the use cases.
3. Uncomment the next use case and make it work. Frequently this means replacing
   `____`s with code of your own.
4. Verify it works by running the file with the `node` command line program.
5. Go to 3 until all use cases are functioning.
6. Goto 1 until you've worked through all the javascript files.
